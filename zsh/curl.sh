# curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
# parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

# If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"

# For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"

# For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"

# zsh completions have been installed to:
#   /usr/local/opt/curl/share/zsh/site-functions
